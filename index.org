* I'm Jacob MacDonald.

And this is my website. (Welcome!)

** The source code's on [[https://chiselapp.com/user/jaccarmac/repository/jaccarmac-dot-com][a Chisel-hosted Fossil repository]].

   I call this version =v0.5.2=.

   As of yet, this place is pretty bare. But, you can find me in all the usual
   places.

   - [[https://freedom.horse/@jaccarmac][freedom.horse]] (federation is neat).

** Emacs.

I love me some Emacs. This site was made with it. You can look at the
[[https://chiselapp.com/user/jaccarmac/repository/dot-emacs-dot-d][configuration I used]].

If you're an Emacs user, check out this [[https://github.com/jaccarmac/quse-package][nifty package I made]]. It lets you
download other packages and configure them (lazily!) To be fair, the hard work
is done by two of the most useful packages for Emacs, IMO, =quelpa= and
=use-package=.

** Solri.

I run the [[https://zod.that.world/giveaway/][Solri]] star [[https://bud.jaccarmac.com/][=~bud=]].
