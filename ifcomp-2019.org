** Notes.

   * Tropey, and not in a way I liked.
   * Thief's dialect was ridiculous.
     * Could have been used as a joke with the other characters interpreting,
       but wasn't.
   * "Try again" throwing me back to the beginning was jarring until I figured
     out a smarter navigation strategy.
   * Lots of little copy-editing misses.

* The good people

** Notes.

   * Cool format, though some text was a little slow.
   * Very atmospheric, I got some shivers.
   * Want to think about it before replaying.
   * What does it mean?
   * I'm either oblivious or the setting is well-disguised as subtle.
