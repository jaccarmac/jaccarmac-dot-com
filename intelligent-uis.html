<p>I've been running the Android P beta for a few months now. By far the most annoying part of my experience has been a feature that I can't find an official name for. For the purposes of this essay I'll refer to it as &quot;self-hating notifications&quot;. A particularly egregious case of attempted self-destruction occurred this morning, and thus I found the <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/08/introducing-android-9-pie.html">announcement later in the day</a> hilarious in a way. Google and every other trendy tech company is jumping on the machine-learning-user-interaction bandwagon, and it's a disaster. And as you'll see I say that as someone who could sometimes use some help with using my software. So let's ramble about how horrible this hype train is and some half-baked solution to the whole mess.</p>
