   * Used hint system too much (maybe just me).
   * Sloppy code around lens.

   * Politics were a little... on the nose.
   * Really really fun game loop.
   * IF-ness of the game wasn't impressive at first, but drew me in over time.

   * READING THE POEM FELT AMAZING.
   * I'm a sucker for poems.
   * Scrolling implementation is weird.
   * At least one minor spelling error (pub -> pup).
   * Seemed to be based on a "force you to continue when one choice is
     unexplored" mechanic.
   * Not a fan of the ending, docked a point.

   * Endless loops are cooler than people give them credit for.
   * The way the end text was hidden slightly confused me.
   * Compared to the reviews I read:
     * The end text was far easier to find.
     * The tone was far less dark.
