The prose was a delight, making my final verdict "a fine piece of minimalist
detective noir". I did run into a problem that seems common (since I had to
read reviews to finish): There is little connection between most of the game
and the solution. I slept on that and realized it isn't /technically/ true. The
key to the mystery is given early, and nibbled at my brain throughout my
playthrough. It was emphasized by unfamiliar but pervasive hinting. I felt
stupid because of what appear still to be red herrings and locked doors, and
that's something I never want to feel at the end of a mystery game. But in the
end I have to respect the cleverness of the solution. A slightly smoother
implementation or pertinent help text would do a lot for this one.

Formally, I expected to really dislike the simple task loop. Happily, the world
is fleshed out with additional scenes which make me happy I spent some time in
the world. I found the cattle solution second, by stumbling onto its solution
more or less randomly. I may revisit the game to see the failure condition
because it felt easier to get stuck than to lose altogether. The "house rules"
are just enough shine on the Twine part: Besides that, it feels like a very
straightforward IFComp choice game. I hope we see more!
