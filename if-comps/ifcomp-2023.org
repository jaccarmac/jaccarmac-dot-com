Tricks of light is from a favorite (wish I could say perennial, but I think
that I have in fact only played Pseudavid's The good people, which I adored)
and an auspicious starting point, as I noted CMG starting with its review but
not who CMG was (another favorite, it turns out). The game is a too-appropriate
companion to my last book club book, which generated similar reactions for
similar reasons. The (evidently Gruescript) form works well here, but is also
somewhat frustrating for a parser-focused player: There's a lot of work in the
subtleties of retracing steps. The game does capture perfectly the feeling of a
venture just too far into the forest: Too well in "scoring terms", if the
player feels the parental rules pressing on them. The affordances for reading
and interacting have just a bit too much friction, especially the switching-to
and reading-of the map. Narrative flow, as such, is linear, but it really seems
that that isn't the point, and the mood of the piece is very near
seamless. Even played fast, as I sinfully did. I'm not a particular good child,
both Tricks and the Blue Book demonstrate.
